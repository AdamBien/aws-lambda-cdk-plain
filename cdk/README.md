# Slightly Streamlined AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) Boilerplate

This module is based on [aws-cdk-plain](https://github.com/AdamBien/aws-cdk-plain) 
which fully relies on [AWS CDK for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-java.html).

## Installation

1. Install [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
2. [`cdk boostrap --profile YOUR_AWS_PROFILE`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)

## Useful commands

 * `mvn package`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
